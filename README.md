# 📊 Operational Analytics & Metric Spike Investigation

## Project Overview
In this project, I stepped into the role of a **Lead Data Analyst** at a company like Microsoft, applying advanced SQL techniques to uncover operational insights and investigate sudden changes in key performance metrics. The analysis spans two major case studies, each focusing on different facets of business operations, from reviewing content moderation throughput to measuring user and email engagement.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Advanced SQL (Window Functions, Aggregates, Joins)**
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**
- **Business Scenario Simulations**

## 📂 Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

**Dataset: `job_data`**
> Columns: `job_id`, `actor_id`, `event`, `language`, `time_spent`, `org`, `ds`

### ✅ Key Tasks & Insights

- **📅 Jobs Reviewed Over Time**  
  _Insight:_ Identified job review trends by hour/day for November 2020 to pinpoint peak moderation activity.

- **📈 Throughput Rolling Average**  
  _Insight:_ Calculated a 7-day rolling average of throughput (events/second), showing smoother trends for performance monitoring compared to daily metrics.

- **🈳 Language Share Analysis**  
  _Insight:_ Discovered dominant and underused languages over the past 30 days, aiding in resource allocation and localization strategies.

- **🔁 Duplicate Detection**  
  _Insight:_ Detected and flagged duplicate records in `job_data`, ensuring cleaner operations for downstream analysis.
